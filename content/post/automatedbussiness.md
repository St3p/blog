The idea of a robot or android or whatever technological being doing chores for human beings had always been there, in every futuristic movie or carton there is a bot that its main job is to make menial chores. Nowadays it is a reality, it began with little machines that swept and mopped the floor but know it had evolved into whole places that run without human interaction. Shops and fast-food restaurants that ad no longer human employees but robots that manage to do the same work more efficiently, precise, and quick, here are three examples of this places:
