The industrial robot is a programmable manipulator in three or more axes with various purposes, automatically controlled and re-programmable. The field of industrial robotics can be defined as the study, design and use of robots for the execution of industrial processes.

There are 5 types of robots:

* Manipulative robots.
* Learning or repetition robots.
* Computer robots.
* Intelligent (experimental) robots.
* Micro and nanorobots.


# 5. FANUC M-2000iA/1700L

  The strongest 6 axis robot on the market, it comes with a handling capacity up to 2.3 t and a reach up to 4.7 m. This makes it the ideal choice for handling and palletizing heavy parts. Its outstanding vertical 6.2 m lifting stroke and horizontal reach makes processing even the largest of workpieces easy. Especially suitable for the automotive or metal industries, these heavy payload robots lift complete cars efficiently and safely.

# 2. Pegasus Amazon

 Orange robots, about the size of a big suitcase, buzz through the Amazon sortation center in Denver, Colorado. Conveyor belts on top of the robots look like a mini treadmill for packages that are delivered to one of hundreds of chutes in the warehouse. Amazon associates rely on software to guide the company's newest robotic drive units, which help get packages to customers more quickly.

 # 1. Handle Robot Reimagined for Logistics

 Handle is a mobile manipulation robot designed for logistics. Handle autonomously performs mixed SKU pallet building and depalletizing after initialization and localizing against the pallets. The on-board vision system on Handle tracks the marked pallets for navigation and finds individual boxes for grasping and placing.
 When Handle places a boxes onto a pallet, it uses force control to nestle each box up against its neighbors.  The boxes used in the video weigh about 5 Kg (11 lbs), but the robot is designed to handle boxes up to (15 Kg) (33 lb).  This version of Handle works with pallets that are 1.2 m deep and 1.7 m tall (48 inches deep and 68 inches tall).
