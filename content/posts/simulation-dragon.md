## simulation of mechanisms using Solidworks.

The Mechanism used to recreate the movement is
the slider crank. This Mechanism is one of
the most used systems in the mathematical field,
it is an arrangement of parts designed to make
a rotary straight motion movement as the
type of movement that makes a piston
engine, so me can define it as one type of
four bar linkages which has three revolute
joints and one sliding joint.

The coordinate system to this type of
mechanism should make the x-axis and the
slider one coincide, so we can associate a
vector with each link also we can say that
the magnitude of this vector is the length of
the link that is being analyzed, the direction
of the vector is along the link, so we can
conclude that the system made a loop.
