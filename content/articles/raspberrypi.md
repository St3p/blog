# What is a raspberry pi?

The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).

# What Raspberry Pi models have been released?

There have been three generations of Raspberry Pis: Pi 1, Pi 2, and Pi 3, and there has generally been a Model A and a Model B of most generations. Model A is a cheaper variant and tends to have reduced RAM and ports like USB and Ethernet. The Pi Zero is a spinoff of the original (Pi 1) generation, made even smaller and cheaper.

# What can you do with a Raspberry Pi?

Some people buy a Raspberry Pi to learn to code, and people who can already code use the Pi to learn to code electronics for physical projects. The Raspberry Pi can open opportunities for you to create your own home automation projects, which is popular among people in the open source community because it puts you in control, rather than using a proprietary closed system.
