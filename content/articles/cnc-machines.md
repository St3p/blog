# What is a CNC?

CNC are manufacturing machines that run on numeric controlled programs to manufacture parts of high precision for the industry. The CNC uses different software's to control all of the machines motions as the spindle speed and the axes movements. This machines uses a special language called “G-Code”.

Before the CNC Machines the manufacture parts were done manually by machinists, they were less precise and took a lot more time than tne CNC the be done. With this machining tools the industry  got an increase in their productivity thanks to the capacity of the mchine to run automatically without the constant attention of an operator.

# CNC Milling Machines


In a mill, the cutter is placed in the spindle where it rotates. The workpiece then moves past the cutter so that chips may be sliced off. The act of cutting a workpiece on a mill is called “Milling”.

CNC Mills have at the very least the ability to cut in 3 dimensions which are referred to as the X, Y, and Z axes.  Each axis is controlled by a servo or stepper motor that is triggered by the CNC Control.

# CNC Lathes

Some view Lathes as the only universal CNC Machine because a lathe can make all of the parts needed for another lathe. A lathe spins the workpiece in a spindle while a fixed cutting tool approaches the workpiece to slice chips off of it. Because of this geometry, lathes are ideal for parts that have symmetry around some axis that could be chucked up in the spindle.

CNC Lathes have at the very least the ability to drive the cutting tool under g-code control over 2 axes, referred to as X and Z. They may have a considerable amount of other functionality as well, and there are many variations on lathes such as Swiss Lathes.

# CNC Routers

A CNC Router is actually a type of CNC Mill, typically one that uses what’s called a “gantry” configuration. They’re called CNC Routers instead of CNC Gantry Mills when they’re used to cut wood, but this need not exclusively be the case.  A typical CNC Router is usually not capable of as much precision as a CNC Mill.  They sacrifice some precision in the name of a larger work envelope with the gantry design.

Many think of CNC machines as being focused on cutting metal, but there is a huge market for CNC woodworking machines of which the CNC Router is the principle example.

# CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets

CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets are different kinds of CNC Machines that are used primarily to cut parts out of flat sheet material.

# Even More CNC Machines

The list of CNC Machines is extensive.  Here are some of the other possibilities we haven’t mentioned:

- CNC Electronic Discharge Machines (“EDM’s”)
- CNC Foam Cutters
- CNC Wire Bending and Tubing Bending Machines
- CNC Punches
- CNC Embroidery Machines (they put custom logos on Baseball caps!)
- CNC Pattern Cutters (for cutting vinyl, paper, and more in precise patterns)
- CNC Food Makers (for cake decoration and more)
- CNC Pottery Printers (a form of 3D Printer)
