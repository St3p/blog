# What is cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.

#  Advancements on cybersecurity

1. Blockchain
The digital ledger allows for the secure sharing of information and identity authentication, without the typical risks of exposing data to outsiders.

2. Cloud Technology
e diverse array of data that can be stored on a single cloud account is staggering but this also exposes users to obvious security flaws. Fortunately, cloud security has made leaps and bounds in recent years, with developers ensuring that all data is much better protected against hacks than before.

3. IoT Security
One of the major flaws with early-release Internet of Things technology is that it connected multiple devices without a common security apparatus.
Nowadays it is common for IoT software to have a cybersecurity infrastructure that can be shared with all devices within a household.
