# 1. Is easy to learn

For a new programmer, learning a new programming language is often intimidating at first. But like any popular language, Python has a lot of documentation to help you on your way.

For example, Python.org offers a beginner's guide to programming and Python. If you are a visual learner, Microsoft has a video series, "Python for Beginners," with dozens of lessons.

# 2. short coding

You don't need to write a lot of code to get the job done. Therefore, programmers are more productive in Python compared to languages that require a lot of standard code to perform common tasks.

Also, in the DevOps world, Python is very popular, engineers can automate tasks with fewer lines of code, so they can focus on further reducing technical burden.

# 3. A great community of developers

As with any language, a strong community is essential for everything from new feature development to bug fixes.

You can solve almost all problems in Python, and you will find many other useful libraries for writing concise and readable code.

# 4. Python is growing

According to the 2020 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey, Python ranks third among the most loved and most wanted programming languages.

Python is versatile and constantly reinvents itself as developers keep up with trends without having to re-learn everything from scratch.

Python's easy integrations with C, C ++, and Java, as well as constant updates, keep developers connected and up-to-date.

# 5. Job opportunities

Big tech companies like Google, Uber, and Netflix use language. As a Python developer, it's easier to find work because big tech companies are always looking to add to their pool of skilled developers.

That means smaller companies embrace the language as well, creating many opportunities not only to create new products, but also to maintain and improve legacy code.

# It's main cualities:
  - Python = Simplicity
  - It is an open-source language
  - It is a high-level language
  - It is interpreted
  - It is both object-oriented and functional
  - It is portable
  - It is extensible and embeddable
