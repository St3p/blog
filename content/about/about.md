I am a Mechatronics engineering student and during my degree, I have developed multiple projects of mechanical design, automation, robotics and mechanical systems, the most interesting ones I have published in this blog.
My goal is to become a professional as complete as possible, with skills beyond the practical application of the knowledge acquired in the career. This is why at this moment I am expanding my programming knowledge. Developing my knowledge in HTML and Javascript for software development.
If you are interested in knowing more about my projects, do not hesitate to ask.
